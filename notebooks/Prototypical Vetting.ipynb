    "## Prototypical Vetting\n",
    "Given a low-dimensional embedding of the data, the idea of prototypical vetting is to estimate a \"prototype\" member for each class in the embedding space and then to pick a batch of new points to vet that are either close to the prototypes (reinforce the notion) or far away (adjust the model).  This idea was inspired by __[Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the strategy requires an embedding of the data.  In this implementation, we assume the underlying model is a tensorflow model and that one of the layers can serve as the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototypical query strategy proceeds in two basic steps:\n",
    "* Initialization.  First, we try to select a small number of examples from each class.  We require at least `min_examples` items from each class.  These initial examples are chosen at random from the `min_examples * sample_window` items in which the classifier is most confident.\n",
    "* Selection based on prototypes.  Once we have enough initial examples, we compute the prototype for each class.  The prototype for a class is a weighted average of the vetted items assigned to that class and the unvetted items predicted to be in that class.  Then, we compute the Euclidean distance from each unvetted item to each prototype.  Then, we select the `batch_size / 2` items closest to the prototypes and the `batch_size / 2` items farthest from any of the prototypes.  Recall that `batch_size` is a parameter of the `query_vetted` method.  Then, we iteratively update the prototypes and distances and select batches of items to vet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some of our other vetting strategies, prototypical has a few parameters that need to be set. \n",
    "* `weights`: default=[.6,.2,.2], The weights determine how the prototypes are updated after each batch is vetted.  The first entry of the list is the weight applied to the vetted items, the second is the weight applied to the previous prototypes, and the third is the weight applied to the model's prediction for the unvetted items.\n",
    "* `min_examples`: default=5, the minimum number of examples for each class needed to initilize strategy.  We vet the items with the highest model confidence for each class, until the number of desired examples is reached for each class.\n",
    "* `sample_window`: default=2, this number is multiplied by the min_examples to give E potential examples to vet during the initializing steps. Min is 2.\n",
    "* `use_unvetted`: default=False, whether to use the models predictions in making the prototypes.  If false the weight for those will be set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `min_examples` x (number of classes) should be less than or equal to the total budget, else we may never got out of the initialization phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this strategy works well with the Naive estimator, we recommend using it with the Learned estimator with the `use_features` parameter set to `True`, as the points it vets are distributed unevenly in the embedding space."
